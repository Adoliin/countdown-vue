## Usage
Set the date and name of countdown and press "Save new" and then the URL to that
countdown will show up. You can use it anywhere you want by embedding it as an
iframe on a website or by just sharing it.
You can add as many countdowns as you want as they will be saved as a cookie in
your browser, so if you delete the cookie session of the website all of your
created countdowns will be deleted.
You can also edit or delete specific countdowns.
